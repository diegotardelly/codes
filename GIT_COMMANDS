Here, we show some useful commands to work with git:


1) Start a new project or repository, so you need to enter in project directory and type:

	$ git init   ---  create skeleton of git.	

2) Add repo origin:

	$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository_name 

3) Pull repository of origin:
	
	$ git pull origin master

4) Add some change: 

	$ git add [file/directory] 

5) Commit your changes:

	$ git commit -m "Descrição" 

6) Send your changes to server repository:

	$ git push origin master 

7) If you want to pull some modifications of server repository, you can use the follow command line:

	$ git fetch origin

8) If you want to know what the branch you are:

	$ git branch

9) Change atual branch:
	
	$ git checkout branch

10) If you want to merge two branches, you need to move to the master branch and type: 

	$ git merge other_branch

11) Create a new branch:

	$ git branch name_of_branch


Steps to insert modifications in repository: 

	7) -> 8) -> 9) -> 4) -> 5) -> 9) -> 10) -> 6)
